<div class='page'>Hello. I&#39;m Matt, an ex-software-engineer and computing omnivore who now pursues offensive information security as a career and hobby. This blog is meant to contain informational articles about hacking and computer exploitation techniques. It&#39;s largely my scratchpad and a way to share what I learn with the world. I&#39;m often told that I&#39;m a straightforward person of few words--until you get me talking about something I love. Then the few words can bloom into a few thousand. I hope at least some of them assist you in solving a problem or stir your curiosity. Thank you for reading.</div>
