<div class='page'>This section of the website discusses software I&#39;ve authored, and the software development techniques used to create it. I try to take a retrospective approach and learn from the past, so there are often comments about how or why I developed a specific program.<br /><br />I make no claim that anything I post here is production-grade perfection. I try to note how mature (or immature) the software I&#39;m describing is. I often write a program to quickly solve a very specific problem, then gradually develop it from disposable tool to reusable piece of software with more general appeal. The extent of my testing before publication is sometimes “well, it worked for me.” There are sometimes bugs. Feel free to report them on the GitHub page for the corresponding software. Include as much information as you feel it wise to include about your specific operating system, programming language version, and so on. This information is often relevant. </div>
